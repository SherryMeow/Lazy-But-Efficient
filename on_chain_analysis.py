#Template for doing Web3 On-Chain Analysis
#Install web3.py: The first step is to install the web3.py library using pip. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
pip install web3

#step 2
#Connect to a blockchain network: You can use the web3.py library to connect to various blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, etc. You need to create a web3 instance and specify the RPC endpoint of the network you want to connect to. For example, to connect to the Ethereum mainnet, you can use the following code:
from web3 import Web3

web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/your-project-id'))

#Replace your-project-id with your Infura project ID.

#step 3
#Get data from the blockchain: Once you are connected to a blockchain network, you can use web3.py to fetch data from the blockchain. For example, to get the balance of an Ethereum address, you can use the following code:
balance = web3.eth.get_balance('0x123...')
print(balance)

#step 4
#Analyze the data: You can use various Python libraries, such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy, to analyze the data you have fetched from the blockchain. For example, you can create a histogram of the transaction fees paid by Ethereum users using the following code:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fees = []
for block in range(10_000_000, 10_000_100):
    block = web3.eth.get_block(block)
    for tx in block.transactions:
        fee = web3.eth.get_transaction(tx).gasPrice * web3.eth.get_transaction_receipt(tx).gasUsed
        fees.append(fee)

plt.hist(fees, bins=50)
plt.show()

#This code fetches the transaction fees of all transactions in a range of Ethereum blocks and plots them in a histogram.These are just some examples of what you can do with web3.py and Python for on-chain data analysis. Depending on your use case, you may need to use different web3.py functions and data visualization libraries.
